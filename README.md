# Projection Effects Comparison between Skysim5000 and Cardinal Catalogs
This project aims to compare projection effects between two simulated galaxy cluster catalogs: Skysim5000 and Cardinal. The comparison focuses on understanding how projection effect as one of the observational systematics affect estimation of the cluster mass using the weak lensing signal and the richness cluster mass relation. We study how the effect of projection effect using the redMaPPer clusters (generated using the redMaPPer algorithm) compares to the simple cylinder depth (30,60,90,120)
