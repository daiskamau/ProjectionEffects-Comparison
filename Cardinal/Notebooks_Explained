Cardinal-1.ipynb File (INCLUDE)
- Load halos (648,278) which is a result of matching the DS and Sigma file computed by Chunhao with the gold catalog because the   ra and dec in the corrected file is not well understood. Not sure how he computed the ra and dec in the corrected file.
- Compute the angular and co-moving distance then save the file.
- Load the gold catalog including the redshift catalog
- Load the redmapper catalog
- Matching halos with the redmapper clusters:
  * Method 1 - using the ra and dec then using a projected distance (radius)
  * Method 2 - using the first id_cent(cluster) and coadd_object_id(halos) quantities respectively
  * Method 3 - Shulei - matching redmapper clusters with the most massive halo
- We bin the (648,278) halos by redshift and richness then quantify the selection bias using the the resulting file of matching halos to clusters using method 2. 
- Plot the deltasigma(DS) and sigma(S) profiles of each bin including the errorbars(std)
- Plot the selection bias of the DS and S profiles for each bin.
- Plot the selection bias comparison of Buzzard with Cardinal
