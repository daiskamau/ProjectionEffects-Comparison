# Projection Effects Comparison between Skysim5000 and Cardinal Catalogs
This project aims to compare projection effects between two simulated galaxy cluster catalogs: Skysim5000 and Cardinal. The comparison focuses on understanding how different methods of projection influence key cluster properties and cosmological parameters derived from the catalogs. The data is analyzed using the GCRCatalogs package and relies on the \redmapper\ algorithm for cluster identification.
